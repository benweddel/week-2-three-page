          <h3>House Leagues – Men’s & Women’s</h3>

          <p>Participation in the leagues is the best way to learn and improve at the sport as well as to meet other members. The format of our leagues allows all levels of players to take part in competitive matches in a fun and social atmosphere. Nearly all our members play in at least one league. These run from September to April and are comprised of four sessions, each running about 8 weeks.</p>

          <h2>Men’s Leagues</h2>

          <h3>Tuesday Evenings</h3>

          <p>Tuesday night play brings together players of roughly the same ability into groups of 8-12 players. Players partner up with a different group member in each of 3 sets, and all the games a player wins over the course of the session are tallied up at the end. Players with the top scores move to a higher group and those with low scores move to a lower group.</p>

          <h3>Wednesday Evenings</h3>

          <p>On Wednesday night, players play with the same partner for the entire 8 week session. On Wednesday night players of all abilities play together, creating a great opportunity for members to practice and learn from more experienced players. Also, because no formal scores are kept, Wednesday nights are very social.</p>
