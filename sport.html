        <h3>Rules</h3>

        <p>The scoring in platform tennis is identical to tennis and rules are very similar with three major differences:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>After the ball lands in the playing surface the player can either play the ball off of the deck or let the ball bounce into the screen(s) and then play the ball directly back into the opposing court</li>
          <li>You only get one serve</li>
          <li>The ball must stay within the confines of the court even after landing in the legal area of play, if it does not then the striker of that ball loses the point</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section class="col-1-2 rules">
        <h3>Strategy</h3>

        <p>With the fairly small court size, short racquet length, and screens surrounding the court just getting the ball back is really your first priority as it is fairly difficult to put the ball away.  When you are at the baseline the shot you will hit most often in platform tennis is the lob and thus when you are at the net you will mostly be hitting overheads.  When you are at the baseline you generally should line yourself up to play most shots with your best ground stroke (forehand or backhand) and when you are at the net most volleys should be played using a backhand volley with your setup favouring that side.</p>

        <p>The best players in platform tennis are the best players because they put a premium on placement and spin over power.</p>
